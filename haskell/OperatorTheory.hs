module OperatorTheory where

-- Define a linear operator type as a function on Double (quantum state value)
type Operator = Double -> Double

-- Quantum Hamiltonian operator: Represents quantum evolution (e.g., kinetic + potential energy)
quantumHamiltonian :: Operator
quantumHamiltonian psi = 0.5 * psi  -- Example: simple scaling as a placeholder

-- Gravitational Hamiltonian operator: Represents effects due to spacetime curvature
gravitationalHamiltonian :: Double -> Operator
gravitationalHamiltonian g = \psi -> g * psi  -- Scaling by gravitational constant g

-- Scaling operator: Scales the input by a given factor
scaleOperator :: Double -> Operator
scaleOperator factor = \x -> factor * x

-- Apply an operator to a quantum state
applyOperator :: Operator -> Double -> Double
applyOperator op psi = op psi

-- Test function for Operator Theory

  let psi = 3.0  -- Example quantum state value
  let op = scaleOperator 2.0
  print $ applyOperator op psi  -- Should scale the result by 2, outputting 6.0
