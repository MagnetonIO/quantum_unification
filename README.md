# Quantum and Classical Mechanics Unified Framework

## Description

This project provides implementations in **Haskell** and **Python** of a unified framework that combines **quantum mechanics** and **general relativity** using:
- **Category Theory**: Models transformations over spacetime points.
- **Topos Theory**: Models quantum observables as sections of sheaves over spacetime.
- **Operator Theory**: Defines operators acting on quantum states.
- **Representation Theory**: Describes time dilation transformations (Lorentz and gravitational) to account for relativistic effects.
- **Time Dilation**: Incorporates the effects of special and general relativity into quantum evolution.

The project culminates in a **Unified Evolution Equation** that applies these concepts to model the evolution of quantum systems in curved spacetime.

## Key Concepts

### Category Theory
- **Objects** represent spacetime points.
- **Morphisms** represent transformations between points.
- A **Functor** maps transformations onto quantum state evolution.

### Topos Theory
- Quantum observables are represented as **sections** of a sheaf over spacetime.
- As the system evolves, the sheaf evolves, representing quantum observables across spacetime.

### Operator Theory
- Defines operators to apply both quantum mechanical and gravitational contributions to quantum states.

### Representation Theory
- Time dilation transformations (from **Lorentz** and **diffeomorphism** groups) modify the quantum stateâ€™s evolution based on both velocity and gravitational field.
